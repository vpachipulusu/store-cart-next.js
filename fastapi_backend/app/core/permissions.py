"""Platform-admin permission model (KAN-46, ADR-003 point 7).

Permissions are ``resource.action`` strings stored on ``admin_users.permissions``.
They are read from the database only. Nothing in a request (header, query,
body) is ever consulted, so a caller cannot widen their own permissions.

Wildcard decision: the stored string ``*`` is honoured only for the
``super_admin`` role, and then it expands to ``ADMIN_PERMISSIONS`` (the known
registry), never to "anything". A ``*`` on any other role is ignored, which
closes the legacy hole where an admin could grant themselves ``*`` (KAN-124).
Unknown strings in the stored list are dropped.

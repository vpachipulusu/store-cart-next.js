"""Is the platform database at the Alembic revision this build was written for? (KAN-253)

No deploy runs ``alembic upgrade head`` (ADR-011). When a backend PR with a platform
migration is deployed before the migration is applied, every query on the changed
tables fails. ``/health/ready`` uses this to answer 503 with the applied and expected
revisions instead of the service failing request by request.

The revisions are constants, not read from ``alembic_migrations/`` at runtime, so the
check does not depend on the migration scripts being in the deployed bundle.
``tests/core/test_platform_schema.py`` fails when a migration is added without
appending it here.
